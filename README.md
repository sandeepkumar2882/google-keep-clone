# Getting Started with Create React App

This Repo is for my learning purpose, in this I have created clone of google keep.

# Installation

### Install node npm
`brew install node`

### Create React App
`npx create-react-app app-name`

### To install all the dependencies from the package.json file, just run the command
`npm i` or `npm install`

### Routing Package Install 
`npm install react-router-dom`
* You can install all other packages that are needed for us like this

### If any package failed installation (try this command once)
`sudo npm cache clean` or `sudo npm cache clean --force `

# Project

## Google-Keep Clone
* I am using localstorage for storing all the data enetered by user. You can easily save your important information in this app.

### Project Path
* src/Index.js (main file in src folder), after this file you can navigate to other files or components.

### Files
* App.js (Responsible for enqueue all the important components).
* components folder have all the components related to chat.

    * Header and footer are just for making look good.
    * CreateNote is the important component to register or save the data.
    * Note component is responsible for displaying all the notes and able to delete the note.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### inside the google-keep folder just run the command - `npm run start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
